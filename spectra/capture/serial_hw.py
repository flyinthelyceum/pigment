"""The sensor and the lamp, through an ESP32 on a USB cable.

The ESP32 runs `firmware/circuitpython/code.py`, which answers one line per
command on CircuitPython's data serial channel. These two classes speak that
protocol and satisfy `hw.Sensor` and `hw.Lamp`, so `cycle.py`, `session.py` and
the CLI run unchanged on whatever computer the cable is plugged into. That is the
whole design: the measurement lives here, tested; the board only does what Blinka
did on the Pi. Ruled 2026-10-06 (`docs/DECISIONS.md`).

`pyserial` is imported inside `open_port` and `find_port`, so `import
spectra.capture` still works without the `capture` extra installed.
