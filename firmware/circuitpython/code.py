"""The ESP32 end of Stage 1a: the sensor and the LEDs, answered over USB.

Copy to the CIRCUITPY drive with `boot.py`. Needs `adafruit_as7341` and
`adafruit_tlc59711` in `lib/` (`circup install adafruit_as7341 adafruit_tlc59711`).

Why a bridge and not the measurement itself: the dark/white/sample cycle, the
saturation stop and the session files are `spectra.capture`, already written and
tested. This file only does what the Pi did through Blinka, so that code runs
unchanged on the computer at the other end of the cable. Ruled 2026-10-06
(`docs/DECISIONS.md`).

One line in, one line out, on the data channel `boot.py` enables:

    ID                  -> SPECTRA ESP32 1
    CFG gain atime astep -> OK          gain is the AGAIN code, 0 (0.5x) to 10 (512x)
    READ                -> CH f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 clear nir
    SET channel word    -> OK          word is the 16-bit PWM value, 0 to 65535
    OFF                 -> OK          every channel off
    anything that fails -> ERR message

Pins are the ESP32-S3's own defaults for I2C and SPI (Espressif's Arduino
variant: SDA 8, SCL 9, MOSI 11, SCK 12). CircuitPython's DevKitC-1 boards name no
I2C or SPI pins, so they are chosen here. They are clear of the strapping pins,
the USB pins and the octal PSRAM pins on N8R8 modules.
